# BayesianBookworm: Unraveling Authorship with Bayesian Analysis

## Overview
**BayesianBookworm** is an innovative text analysis tool that harnesses the power of Bayes' Theorem to determine the probable authorship of literary texts. Initially focusing on the works of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, this project introduces a novel approach to authorship attribution.

## üìö Current Functionality

### Data Foundation
The program analyzes texts from the following novels, located in the `Books/` directory:
- **Jane Austen**: _Emma (em)_, _Pride and Prejudice (pp)_, _Persuasion (pe)_, _Sense and Sensibility (ss)_
- **Charles Dickens**: _Great Expectations (ge)_, _Hard Times (ht)_, _A Tale of Two Cities (tc)_, _Oliver Twist (ot)_

### üìà Word Frequency Analytics
A sophisticated dictionary maps word frequencies across these novels, forming the backbone for authorship prediction:
```python
word_frequencies = {
    "officer": [220, 322]  # Austen: 220, Dickens: 322
}
```

### üîç Identifying the Author
The `guess.py` script employs this frequency data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the author of a given text passage.
